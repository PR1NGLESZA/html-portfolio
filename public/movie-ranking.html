<h1>The Best Movies According to Regardt</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Matrix</h3>

<p>This is my favourite movie of all time becuase I concider it my first best movie
that stuck with me for a very long time.
</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>

<p>An absolute marvel of a Sci-Fi movie that I've seen multiple times and probably
will see a few more times in the future.

<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>Another Sci-Fi favourite of mine. Absolutely amazing for the time it was released
it. It has a special place in my heart.
