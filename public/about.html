<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've always been involved in tech from a young age and computers are my passion</p>

<p>I've been dabbling in some self taught programming, but unitl now, I haven't challenged myself too much by taking up new programming chalanges.</p>

<p>With that being said I have now taken the leap to learing full stack development, which I plan on incorporating into my work enviroment to make my tasks easier and less time consuming</p>
